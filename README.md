## My process

Quickest one so far. Was able to do every challenge proposed without any major problem. Could be a little bit better, but I'm satisfied by this one, using bootstrap to make it resposive was the biggest acomplishment.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- CSS Grid




### Continued development

Used some tips left on my first upload on frontendmentor.io 

<main> tag, <h1> marker and some div centralization that I'm starting to figure it out after a lot of tips and study.

### Useful resources

@Hassiai coment, made me finally learn once for all the best way to put my images on the center of a page. Thank you!
